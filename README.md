# C STL
 A recreatation of the Cpp STL for C

 ## Basic concepts: 

 Every macro starting with "make" should be used to generate functions.
 The arguments for the macro should be similiar for every make_"algo":
 * **name** of the functions
 * on what **type** will the predicate act upon
 * an optional **return type** that will be used
 * the **predicate** that will act on elements (unary, binary, possibly ternary)
